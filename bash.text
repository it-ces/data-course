if we want establish our working directory in _folderB_ we must
uses a absolute path in the following way.
```bash
cd \home\user\folderRoot
```
but if we want to change to folderA we can uses a relative path using
```bash
cd ../folderA
```
then if we need for instance come back to folderRoot we only need type
```bash
cd ..
``
